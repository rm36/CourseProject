Abstract:
MOOCs will come with an integrated course chat, for a more integrated cohesive system where students may post questions in real time (as people sometimes do in twitch or youtube live), and they are linked to the video lecture's timestamp. This can help them communicate with other students, e.g. as a student, seeing a classmate's emoji could help them feel less isolated, feel understood and optionally reading through students concerns about the material is enlightening, without having to open another tool. As a teacher, this can provide valuable feedback to improve. This project will analyze real-time video-synced students' comments on any given lecture to provide insight on which phrases are confusing, helpful or make students feel in any given way to incorporate into the current communication or future lectures.
